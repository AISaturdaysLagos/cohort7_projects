## Team Machel
[President Samora Moisés Machel](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Samora_Machel) was the first president of Mozambique, a Mozambican military commander and political leader. On June 25, 1975, President Machel proclaimed "the total and complete independence of Mozambique and its constitution as the People's Republic of Mozambique", which he said would be "a state of People's Democracy, in which, under the leadership of the worker-peasant alliance, all patriotic strata commit themselves to the destruction of the sequels of colonialism and to annihilate the system of exploitation of man by man." This team was named after President Machel in recognition of his many contributions to a better world.
